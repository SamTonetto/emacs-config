# emacs-config

Basically just my emacs config. A lot of it is taken from Mike Zamansky's great Youtube series on Emacs.

The org-mode file contains the bulk of my settings. Github tries to format it as html so you'll have to view the raw code to use it as an actual file.

There is a pretty good chance that on a fresh Emacs install, the config will break somewhere, since I haven't tested it on a fresh install. Nonetheless, most parts should work ok as long as 'use-package' has been installed.
